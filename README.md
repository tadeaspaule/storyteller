# Storyteller
#### To start telling your stories, use the online editor <a rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://tadeaspaule.github.io/?tab=storyteller">here</a>

## NOTE: The files are outdated and were meant to work with my old hosting service. Everything's been changed slightly now that it's hosted on GitHub Pages and my whole website is rebuilt, but the files can still serve as a rough outline on how Storyteller works

##### You can use this storytelling system for all kinds of stories, be it fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, or a straight-up game, the limit is your imagination!
### I hope you enjoy using Storyteller
