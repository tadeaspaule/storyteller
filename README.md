## Folders briefly described:

### Reader

## What is Storyteller?
Storyteller is meant to be an easy way to tell a branching story, where the reader's choice affects the story they are told. Storyteller equips you with tools to make this happen:
- The story is divided into nodes (places/pieces of text/whatever you make them!)
- Nodes can have many paths leading from them through choices
- The reader can have stats (like in a video game!)
- You can restrict choices the reader can make based on their stats
- You can make a choice affect the reader's stats

#### An example
- You can tell a fantasy, RPG-esque story
- The starting node can have the reader choosing whether they're a mage, warrior, etc.
- Then, based on their choice, you set the player's 'class' stat
- Afterwards, you can restrict choices based on this class stat, for example only wizards can go study magic

### You can use this storytelling system for all kinds of stories, be it fantasy, sci-fi, mystery, or a straight-up game, the limit is your imagination!
### I hope you enjoy using Storyteller
